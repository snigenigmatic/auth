A simple and lightweight API to authenticate PESU credentials using PESU Academy.

The API is secure and protects user privacy by not storing any user credentials. It only validates credentials and
returns the user's profile information. No personal data is stored.

## PESUAuth LIVE Deployment

* You can access the PESUAuth API endpoints [here](https://pesu-auth.onrender.com/).
* You can view the health status of the API on the [PESUAuth Health Dashboard](https://xzlk85cp.status.cron-job.org/).

> [!NOTE]
> All timestamps are in UTC.

> [!WARNING]
> The live version is hosted on a free tier server located in the United States. As a result, you *might* experience higher latencies and slower response times, compared to running the API locally or on a server closer to your location.

## How to run PESUAuth locally

Running the PESUAuth API locally is simple. Clone the repository and follow the steps below to get started.

> [!TIP]
> We recommend running the API locally using Docker for ease of use, the best performance, and lowest latency.

### Running with Docker

This is the easiest and recommended way to run the API locally. Ensure you have Docker installed on your system. Run the
following commands to start the API.

1. Build the Docker image either from the source code or pull the pre-built image from Docker Hub.

    1. You can build the Docker image from the source code by running the following command in the root directory of
       the repository.
       ```bash
       docker build . --tag pesu-auth
       ```

    2. You can also pull the pre-built Docker image
       from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/pesudev/pesu-auth/general) by running the
       following command:
       ```bash
       docker pull pesudev/pesu-auth:latest
       ```

2. Run the Docker container
    ```bash
    docker run --name pesu-auth -d -p 5000:5000 pesu-auth
    # If you pulled the pre-built image, use the following command instead:
    docker run --name pesu-auth -d -p 5000:5000 pesudev/pesu-auth:latest
    ```

3. Access the API at `http://localhost:5000/`

### Running without Docker

If you don't have Docker installed, you can run the API natively. Ensure you have Python 3.11 or higher
installed on your system. We recommend using a package manager like [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) to manage
dependencies.

1. Create a virtual environment using and activate it. Then, install the dependencies using the following commands.
    ```bash
    uv venv --python=3.11
    source .venv/bin/activate
    uv sync
    ```

2. Run the API using the following command.
    ```bash
    uv run python -m app.app
    ```

3. Access the API as previously mentioned on `http://localhost:5000/`

## How to use the PESUAuth API

The API provides multiple endpoints for authentication, documentation, and monitoring.

| **Endpoint**    | **Method** | **Description**                                        |
|-----------------|------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| `/`             | `GET`      | Serves the interactive API documentation (Swagger UI). |
| `/authenticate` | `POST`     | Authenticates a user using their PESU credentials.     |
| `/health`       | `GET`      | A health check endpoint to monitor the API's status.   |
| `/readme`       | `GET`      | Redirects to the project's official GitHub repository. |
| `/metrics`      | `GET`      | Returns current application metrics and counters.      |

### `/authenticate`

You can send a request to the `/authenticate` endpoint with the user's credentials and the API will return a JSON
object, with the user's profile information if requested.

#### Request Parameters

| **Parameter** | **Optional** | **Type**    | **Default** | **Description**                                                                                 |

| `fields`      | Yes          | `list[str]` | `None`      | Which fields to fetch from the profile information. If not provided, all fields will be fetched |

#### Response Object

On authentication, it returns the following parameters in a JSON object. If the authentication was successful and
profile data was requested, the response's `profile` key will store a dictionary with a user's profile information.
**On an unsuccessful sign-in, this field will not exist**.

| **Field**   | **Type**        | **Description**                                                          |

### `/health`

This endpoint can be used to check the health of the API. It's useful for monitoring and uptime checks. This endpoint
does not take any request parameters.

#### Response Object

| **Field** | **Type**   | **Description**                                                   |
